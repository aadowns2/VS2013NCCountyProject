# VS2013NCCountyProject
This project uses the opensource Leaflet library to create data visualization maps.  Included in this is mock data for relative North Carolina counties wherein the user can see median and average GRE scores and number of students admitted to Western Carolina University.

Attached in the DatabaseScripts folder is a zipped .sql file to create the school database and insert values and all relavant stored procedures.  Execute the sql file in SSMS before running the NCCounty project.
